These are little bot scripts to automatically interact with the 
Chronicling America twitter account.

More about Chronicling America can be found at:

  http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov

To use any of the scripts you'll need to copy config.py.template to 
config.py and add Twitter and bit.ly credentials to it.

Afterwards you should be able to run the headline.py script from 
cron every day for a headline from a hundred years ago.
